    <h1>The best movies according to David!</h1>
    <h2>My top three movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Jurasic Park</h3>
    <p>
      A great movie that changed the course of films when it was released in
      1993. Its a bout a corportion that builds a theme park using cloning of
      extinct dinosaurs, but on the weekend they have a trial run, things get
      out of hand. It is a non stop thrill for everyone with danger around every
      corner. 5/5 stars
    </p>
    <h3>Ghostbusters</h3>
    <p>
      !984 was a good year for movies, also the year i was born. This movie is
      about a team of scientist who find out how to trap ghost and decide to
      make it a business. A non stop funny bones comedy with laughs and drama.
      5/5 stars.
    </p>
    <h3>A nightmare on Elm Street</h3>
    <p>
      Another greath 1984 flick. This movie is a about a child predator who was
      killed by the parents of his victims. He somehow comes back to haunt the
      dreams of the kids who are now teenagers, but when you die in your dreams,
      you die in real life. How can you stop Freddy Krueger. 5/5 stars
