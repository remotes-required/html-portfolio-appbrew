<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 39 years old and looking into a change in my life. I have Kidney disease and have recently had a left foot amputation due to complications of Charcot Arthropathy.
  I lost my mom in December 2023, she showed me no matter your age you can always change things you want to change. My mother shaped me and my life. A lot of what I am now
  is because of her and her desire to be better.

<p>I have an Eighteen year old son who lives with me. He will graduate this year and he is not sure what he wants to do with his life. I hope to show him the things i learned and more. 
  I want him to be the best version of himself and find something in life that makes him happy. With me, I love computers and technology, which is why I am getting into coding. I should
  have started earlier but I always used to think to work in tech I needed to live on the west coast. I couoldn't do that, I love the east coast too much. I realized later in life that I 
  could persue my passion and stay put. By the time I realized it though i had a good job and a chold to raise. When I was told about my kidney disease that is when things changed for me. I
  almost died quite a few times in the last few years, so I am now trying to do what makes me happy.
